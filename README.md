# International week - OHL data analysis (Group 15)

## Out of posession

In this project, we will analyze the data provided to us by OHL. The goal is to find out how the team performed when they were out of possession (defense).

In each subfolder, you will find code that tries to answer a specific question. The code is organized in a way that allows you to run each part independently.

To run the code, simply create a virtual environment and install the requirements. You can do this by running the following commands:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And create a `.env` file with the following content:

```bash
PG_PASSWORD=
PG_USER=
PG_HOST=
PG_PORT=
PG_DB=
```
